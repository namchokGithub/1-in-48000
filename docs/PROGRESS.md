# Progress

Detailed implementation status. `README.md` holds the high-level roadmap; keep both aligned when a status changes materially.

Status values: `Todo`, `In progress`, `Blocked`, `Done`.

## Open work index

Every item not `Done`. Update this section whenever an item's status changes.

| #   | Step                           | Status | Depends on |
| --- | ------------------------------ | ------ | ---------- |
| 30  | Converted flow review          | Todo   | —          |
| 32  | BO Flow detail panel + preview | Todo   | 28         |
| 33  | V4 Player check + test         | Todo   | 30, 32     |

V4 order: rules and engine with the story conversion first (27–28), then the validator (29), then the BO Flow editor (31–32) and the author's review of the converted flow (30), then Player check (33). Requirements source: `docs/REQUIREMENT-V4.md`. The production release is still deferred while the author makes further adjustments.

## Open decisions

None. V4 decisions 1–9 were resolved on 2026-10-29 and are recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md` ("Graph-driven story flow").

## Future

- Share a life result (not scheduled).

Resolved choices are recorded in `docs/DECISIONS.md`.

Implementation details for completed steps are recorded in [`COMPLETE-LOG.md`](COMPLETE-LOG.md).

## 30. Converted flow review

**Status:** Todo

The one-time conversion moved into Step 28 so the game and tests keep working. This step is the author's review of the converted story on the BO Flow board.

- Review the converted order, conditional edges, random pools, Next Period nodes, and graduation endings on the board.
- Rearrange cards with auto layout; adjust edges where the mechanical conversion does not match the intended story.

**Done when:** the author accepts the converted flow in BO.

## 32. BO Flow detail panel + preview

**Status:** Todo

Step 31 added the Condition, Random, Ending, and edge forms, and an event editor modal on the Flow board.

- Engine trace for preview: path taken, state, and why each condition passed or failed (moved from Step 28).
- Preview highlights the real path with current state and condition pass/fail reasons.
- Preview of an event not yet placed on the board ends with a "No path" message today; give it a clear Thai message.

**Done when:** Preview shows the highlighted path with reasons, and an unplaced event's preview explains what to connect.

## 33. V4 Player check + test

**Status:** Todo

- Confirm the Player runs on the flow engine with no visible regressions.
- Check story paths, random restore after refresh, program review, and endings.
- Check the BO Flow board on desktop.

**Done when:** V4 is accepted by the author. Release remains a separate, explicit request.
